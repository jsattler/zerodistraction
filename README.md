## Why ZeroDistraction?

You sit down to work on something important.
You open your browser and tell yourself "just one quick check" on HackerNews or YouTube.
Three hours later, you're still scrolling, and that important task remains untouched.
We've all been there.
The internet is designed to capture and hold your attention.

**ZeroDistraction puts you back in control.**
When you need to focus, activate it for a set time period.
Try to visit a distracting site, and instead of endless feeds, you see a simple timer counting down.
It's about creating intentional breaks from distraction when you need to get things done.

## How does it work?

* Set a focus timer for your desired duration
* Distracting websites are automatically blocked during the timer
* Ships with categorized presets (social media, news, entertainment) to block
* Blocked sites show a simple countdown instead of their content
* Configure an allowlist of URLs that remain accessible even during focus sessions
* Timer runs in the background - no need to keep the extension popup open
